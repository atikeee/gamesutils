        <div class="content"><p>Given an array of strings <code>words</code> representing an English Dictionary, return <em>the longest word in</em> <code>words</code> <em>that can be built one character at a time by other words in</em> <code>words</code>.</p>
<p>If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty string.</p>
<p>Note that the word should be built from left to right with each additional character being added to the end of a previous word. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
<strong>Output:</strong> "world"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
</pre>
<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
